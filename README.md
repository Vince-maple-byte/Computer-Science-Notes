# Computer-Science-Notes
This repository saves all of my computer science notes in obsidian notes app
Purpose of this is so that I can share my notes throughout different devices without paying for the obsidian sync membership, and also saving these notes for when I want to transfer them to another app.
Anyone who sees this repository is free to use the information here.
