#### Definition of Packet Switching:
Data being sent from an end system is segmented and each segment has a header byte. This is called packets.
The data in packets are reassembled into the original data when it reaches the original destination end system.
Two prominent types of packet switches are routers and link-layer switches.
The sequence of [[Communication Links]] and packet switches a packet has gone through is called a route or path through the network.
