Cable Internet access is provided by the same local cable television company.
An example of cable Internet access:

In cable Internet access hundreds to thousands of houses are connected to a fiber node (or neighborhood-level junction) by a coaxial cable.
The fiber node then sends the data sent from the coaxial cable to the cable head end (similar to the CO in [[DSL]]).
At the cable head end, it transforms the signal received into digital and sends it to the internet (similar to the DSLAM in [[DSL]]).
**Note:** Since the coaxial cable is shared between multiple homes, data being downstream (sent to the end system) has to go through the multiple homes. This can affect the internet speed when multiple homes are using the internet at the same time.
