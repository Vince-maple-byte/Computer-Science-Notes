Digital subscriber line (DSL) is a broadband [[Access Networks]] that is provided by the same local telephone company that would provide a wired phone access for the home.
The way DSL works is by taking digital data and converting it to high-frequency tones with a *DSL modem*.
The high-frequency tones would travel through the telephone wires and reach to the central office.
In the central office, a *DSLAM* would determine if the high-frequency tones is a telephone call or digital, and would separate and send them to their respective locations.

The upstream and downstream of DSL is asymmetric with downstream tending to be more then upstream.
**Note:** Internet connection with DSL is highly dependent on the distance between the house and the CO (central office) with a longer distance greatly affecting the performance of the connection.
