# Intro
JSX allows for react to be declarative. It has a similar format to html with some changes (notably class being called className in jsx). JSX allows us to write 'html' code while still being in javascript, all while not having to deal with the DOM. 
 JSX is trans compiled into javascript code that is readable to the browser. Allowing us to 
 avoid sometimes tedious tasks with the DOM and having easy to read code.
