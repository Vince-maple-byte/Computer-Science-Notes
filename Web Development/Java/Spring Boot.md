Spring boot is simply an initializer for spring projects.
In spring, we needed to configure each dependency that we would need for a specific task such as [[rest apis]], connecting to hibernate, etc.
Spring boot provides all of the dependencies already configured right out of the box based on the tasks that you selected when creating the spring boot project.
