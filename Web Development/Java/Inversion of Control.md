**Definition:** This allows for different frameworks (such as [[Spring IoC]]) to handle the entire life cycle of the objects, that way we know that the objects are deleted in an efficient manner, as well as, allowing for [[Dependency Injection]] to work more efficiently. 

Inversion of Control primarily is done by having a container of holds of the necessary objects needed in the program and [[Dependency Injection]] is used for anytime a class needs an object specified in the container.
