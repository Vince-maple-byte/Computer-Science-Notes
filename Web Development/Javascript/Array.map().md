Creates a new array with modified data in a callback function.
```
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]
const squared = arr.map(x => x * x)
```
The example above creates a new array named squared with the modified array of arr with each element being times itself x * x.
The arr array does not change when doing .map() function.
