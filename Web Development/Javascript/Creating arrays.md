They are a couple different ways to create arrays in javascript.

1. let array = [1, 3, 89];
2. let array = new Array();
3. let array = new Array(3);
4. let array = [3];

The first one on the list is the one that is most commonly used by developers when working with arrays. 
The new Array() method allows you to create a blank array that would have the type of undefined, and the new Array(3) just adds 3 elements into the array that would all be undefined.
The last option just creates a empty array that contains 3 undefined elements just like the new Array(3) method.
