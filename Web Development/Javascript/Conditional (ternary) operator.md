The conditional (ternary) operator allows for a short handed version of an if else statement.

The way it works is as follows:
(conditional) ? expression if true : expression if false;

To make this into an else if statement we can just do this:
(conditional) ? expression if true:
(conditional else if1) ? expression if true:
(conditional else if2) ? expression if true:
(conditional else if3) ? expression if true:
expression if false;

This conditional () operator could be used as a replacement for the if, else if, else statements since they can be with relatively less amount of typing.
