[[List of html elements]]
The div element allows for elements to be grouped together. Think of div as a container for grouping certain elements that you want together. This allows for specific css stylizing to be done in these grouped elements.
How the div tag looks like:
```
<div>
	<p>Don't stop the funk!</p>
	<p>Nevermind funk is dead.</p>
</div>
```
