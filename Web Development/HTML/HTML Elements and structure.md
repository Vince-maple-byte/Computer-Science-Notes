## HTML Element
HTML is composed of elements that are responsible of doing specific jobs
Elements are composed of opening and closing tags such as:
```<p>Some information</p>```

The code block shown above is an example of a paragraph element which allows for texts of information to be able displayed on the website.

## HTML Structure
The image below shows the basic structure of HTML:
![[htmlstrc.png]]
The image composes multiple elements. 
1. The first element that can be seen is ```<!DOCTYPE html>```
allows for the computer to identify if the document is html code
2. The second element ```<html>```
is where all of the content of the website is going to be grouped up in the html file
3. The third element ```<head>```
is where all of the meta data and title (which can be seen from the title element inside of the head element) of the website is held and grouped together (information in the head is not seen by the user themselves).
4. The fifth element ```<body>```
which is where all of the content that the user would typically see in a website (This can be seen from the h2 and p tags).

This structure shown above provides a basic overview of the typical HTML website layout with elements being nested within each other.
