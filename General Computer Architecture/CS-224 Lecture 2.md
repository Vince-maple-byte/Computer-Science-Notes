**Busses:** What allows different computer components like the CPU (Processor), Ram, I/O controllers to communicate with each other. The fastest one is the one communicated with the 1.2 cache and the CPU (Processor).

**Embedded Computers:** Small computer systems that are used to do a specific tasks. Ex. Microwaves, car controllers, Mars rover. *It needs to be low cost, low tolerance of failure, limitations on power consumption, and minimum performance requirements.*

**Compiler:** translates a higher level program to assembly. (One to many)

**Assembler:** translate assembly code to machine code. (One to one).

*It is easier to write an assembler than a compiler since it translates one to one with the machine code.*

## Levels of Representation:
**High level Program Language:** Ex. C, C++, Java
Assembly Language: MIPS, Intel x86
**Machine Language Program:** 1s and 0s. Lowest level in the ISA
**Control Signal Specification:** Machine takes the Machine language program and interprets it to tell the specific components of the computer to do specific tasks.
