MIPS (and most likely other assembly languages) use [[Registers]] instead of variables in high level programming languages.

A **word** is a group of 32 bits in the MIPS architecture.

[[Registers]] in MIPS are typically represented as $s0, $s1,...for the registers that correspond to variables in programming languages like C, and $t0 $t1,... for temporary registers. For a more in depth chart for all of the available registers in MIPS [[MIPS Registers]].
