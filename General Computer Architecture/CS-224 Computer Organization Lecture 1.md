## Five Components of a computer:
*Input, output, memory, Datapath, and control*
*Datapath + Control = Processor (CPU)*

**ISA:** The Instruction Set Architecture. This allows for the software to communicate with the hardware without having to worry about the different specs of the hardware. So hardware can be changed depending on performance needs while the software doesn't need to change any of the instruction calls to the hardware.
