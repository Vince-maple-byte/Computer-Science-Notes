Registers are small, fast storage locations in the CPU to access and manipulate data temporally while a program is being executing. 

There are a limited number of registers in a computer with newer computers having 64 bits and the older ones having 32 bits.

The reason for the limited number of registers in a computer has to deal with the fact that a large number of registers may increase the clock cycle time because it would take electronic signals longer since they would have to travel farther.

*Important Note: Effective use of registers is critical to program performance.*
