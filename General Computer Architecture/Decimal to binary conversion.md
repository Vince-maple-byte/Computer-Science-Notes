**Decimal to binary conversion:** 
This can be done by simply dividing the decimal number by 2 and saving the remainder. We then take the result and divide it again and save the remainder. We keep on doing this until we reach 0.
*Example:* 
14 -> 14 / 2 = 7 remainder = 0
			7/2 = 3 remainder = 1
			3/2 = 1 remainder = 1
			1/2 = 0 remainder = 1
			0 We stop here
After this the top to bottom remainders would be represented as right to left in binary. 
That's how we get the binary from a decimal.
